# Libertas

Prototype for a decentralized voting app on Hyperledger Fabric.
Includes chaincode (smart contract) for application logic and an API server used by clients to communicate with Fabric peers on the network. Supports "offline signing", where client apps can be extremely lightweight, without the need to contain the infrastructure required to communicate with the Fabric network.
